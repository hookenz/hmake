# hmake

The plan
--------
Create an make clone that basically copies the functionality of make.
Then take that, and extend it with built in scripting.

Current state
-------------
It's very early days.   Right now, it can build things using basic commands.
However, it doesn't understand any expansion variables or any variables at all so that limits it's usefulness right now.

Why?
----
I was inspired by Task.  But I feel that Makefiles are easier to use and understand and more common than Taskfiles.
And, I was inspired by the personal challenge of "how hard can it be?".  Well, it's looking like it's a little more involved than I first thought.
