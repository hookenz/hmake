# hmake - A "make" clone written in pure go

## The plan
Create an `make` clone that basically copies the functionality of make.
Then take that, and extend it with built in scripting.

## Current state
It's very early days.   Right now, it can build things using basic commands.
However, it doesn't understand any expansion variables or any variables at all so that limits it's usefulness right now.

## Motivation?
I was inspired by Task.  But I feel that Makefiles are easier to use and understand and more common than Taskfiles.
And, I was inspired by the personal challenge of "how hard can it be?".  Well, it's looking like it's a little more involved than I first thought.
I will press on but it might be slow because I'm a quite busy.
